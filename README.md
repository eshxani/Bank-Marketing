The project analyzes the prior marketing campaign data of a Portugeuse bank and aims to predict whether the customer will subscribe to fixed-term deposit products the bank is offering. The code cleans the data, imputes the missing values, and analyzes and compares different predictive models. The best predictive model is used for the prediction exercise.
